The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a language for describing multi-
participant interactive simulations -- virtual worlds networked via thelglobal-Intemet and
hyperlinked with the World Wide Web. All aspects of virtual world display, interaction
and internetworking can be specified using VRML. It is the intention of its designers that
VRML become the standard language for interactive simulatioﬁ within the World Wide
Web. ///> W
The first version of VRML allows for the creation of,virtual\\vorlds witlglimited
interactive behavior. These worlds can contain objects which havehyperlinks to other
worlds, HTML documents or other valid MIME types.\When the\u/sef selects an object
with a hyperlink, the appropriate MIME viewer~is\launch\ed.\ When the user selects a link
to a VRML document from within a correctly corrfigureEWWW browser, a VRML
viewer is launched. Thus VRML viewers/are the perfect Companion applications to
standard WWW browsers for navigating and visualizing the Web. Future versions of
VRML will allow for richer behaviors, including animations, motion physics and real-
time multi-user interactionﬂ w
This document specifies the feel/tugs aurd‘syntax of Version 1.0 of VRML.

éVRML Missy? Statement
The history of the\d§elopment of the Internet has had three distinct phases; first, the
developm’ent’ofthe TGP/IP infrastructure which allowed documents and data to be stored

m a proxrmally/ln/dependent way; that 18, Internet prov1ded a layer of abstraction between
data sets\and the’hosts which manipulated them. While this abstraction was useful, it was
<alSo co\nfusing;\without any clear sense of "what went where", access to Internet was
restricted to th‘eclass of sysops/net surfers who could maintain internal cognitive maps of
the\daE spaE
\ \// \/
Next, Tim Berners-Lee’s work at CERN, where he developed the hypermedia system
known/as World Wide Web, added another layer of abstraction to the existing structure.
This abstraction provided an "addressing" scheme, a unique identifier (the Universal
Resource Locator), which could tell anyone "where to go and how to get there" for any
piece of data within the Web. While useful, it lacked dimensionality; there’s no there
there within the web, and the only type of navigation permissible (other than surfing) is
by direct reference. In other words, I can only tell you how to get to the VRML Forum
home page by saying, "httpz/lwww.wired.com/", which is not human-centered data. In. , lllllllllllll

fact, I need to make an effort to remember it at all. So, while the World Wide Web
provides a retrieval mechanism to complement the existing storage mechanism, it leaves
a lot to be desired, particularly for human beings.
Finally, we move to "perceptualized" Internetworks, where the data has-beensensualized,
that is, rendered sensually. If something is represented sensually, it/is/possible\to\make
sense of it. VRML is an attempt (how successful, only time and effortwill tell) to\ place
humans at the center of the Internet, ordering its universe to ouf whims. In order to do

These three phases, storage, retrieval, and perceptu\aliza\t\io\n$analogous to the human
process of consciousness, as expressed in terms of SemantiCs and cognitive science.
Events occur and are recorded (memory);.inferencEs‘arejdrav/n from memory
(associations), and from sets of related €vents,r\n\ap\s of the universe are created (cognitive

ﬁwasgeived in the spring of 1994 at the ﬁrst annual World Wide Web
Coirfrfen/cei? Geneva, Switzerland. Tim Berners-Lee and Dave Raggett organized a
Birds-of—a—Feather (BOF) session to discuss Virtual Reality interfaces to the World Wide
Web. Several BOF attendees described projects already underway to build three
dimensional graphical visualization tools which interoperate with the Web. Attendees
agreed on the need for these tools to have a common language for specifying 3D scene
description and WW hyperlinks -- an analog of HTML for virtual reality. The term
Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) was coined, and the group resolved to begin
specification work after the conference. The word ’Markup’ was later changed to
’Modeling’ to reﬂect the graphical nature of VRML.. , |l||ll|l||l||

Shortly after the Geneva BOF session, the www-vrml mailing list was created to discuss
the development of a speciﬁcation for the ﬁrst version of VRML. The response to the list
invitation was overwhelming: within a week, there were over a thousand members. After
an initial settling-in period, list moderator Mark Pesce of Labyrinth Group announced his
intention to have a draft version of the speciﬁcation ready by the WWW’Fall 1994

this schedule was aggressive, it was achievable provided that the reguirementsfor the

stated that the ﬁle format is available for;use.in.the. open market, and have contributed a
ﬁle format parser into the public domain to bootstrap VRML viewer development.
